# WebRTCAndroidExample
This is the simpliest example of an app that uses WebRTC to send video I could made. I followed some tutorials I found on the Internet,
specially [this series of posts](https://vivekc.xyz/getting-started-with-webrtc-for-android-daab1e268ff4) and Google's official [Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/#0).
